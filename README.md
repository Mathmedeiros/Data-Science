# Matheus Medeiros
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

<div style="text-align: justify">Originally graduated in Mechatronics Engineering at PUC-Minas in Brazil, currently facing challenges as a Data Scientist. During college, from the beginning I developed skills in software development, logical reasoning and analytical skills. I had years of experience as an English language teacher and have participated in numerous leadership projects and practical activities that have developed my communication skills. Such skills are extremely important to my routine as a data scientist, as I'm able to perform tasks that most technology professionals have difficulties, exposing ideas and results in a clear and didactic way.</div>

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Analytics, Data Strutures, Big Data, SQL.
